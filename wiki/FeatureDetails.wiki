== Check-for-update ==

This feature checks for new version. When you check the corresponding menu item in context menu of Power8 button, the check begins the same moment.

After that, the check occurs every 12 hours.

Each check downloads 2.26 KB file named "AssemblyInfo.cs" from the project source code and uses it to identify the version.

At the moment, when version is found, only notification is available, later the auto-update will be implemented.
