=Specific features of Power8 described in details=

== Check-for-update ==

This feature checks for new version. When you check the corresponding menu item in context menu of Power8 button, the check begins the same moment. The check also starts when Power8 is launched if this setting was set previously.

After that, the check occurs every 12 hours.

Each check downloads 2.26 KB file named `"AssemblyInfo.cs"` from the project source code and uses it to identify the version.

At the moment, when version is found, there are 2 possibilities. If update files are available, the update dialog will show up.

In this window, "Download and Update" means Power8 will download the current MSI package (download progress will be shown in progress bar), launch it and exit. At the moment it is not a silent install, you'll have to go through all the steps, though previous version will be removed automatically by installer. In future this may be changed, and silent install will be applied.

Also, when choosing this option, the path to currently run Power8 copy will be passed to installer. This means, if you have 2 instances of P8 on PC, location1 is where P8 is installed, and you unpacked P8 to location2, and launched unpacked version, and the unpacked version triggers the update - the installed version will be removed, and P8 will suggest to install into location2. It is possible to change the default location, of course.

"Download MSI" and "Download 7z" will put corresponding update packages to where you define, and navigate the system to this location.

When any of update files is not available, the simplified message will be displayed<br/>http://i32.fastpic.ru/big/2012/0408/9c/9322a0036f890116bf1ff6e3c526509c.png

This behavior is a subject to change in future.

== Alt+Z hotkey ==

Power8 uses Alt+Z hotkey to show Start Window, like Windows itself reacts on "Windows" key. 

The idea originally was to use "Win+Z" hotkey, but starting Windows8, Win+* combinations are prohibited.

When you press Alt+Z, Power8 determines the location of the Mouse cursor and shows the window in the closest desktop corner possible.

Pressing Alt+Z again will close the window.

== Menu buttons ==

All 5 menu buttons have submenus that contain items. 

For Computer and Libraries (Documents on XP) the items are read and expanded only on demand (when you hover the parent menu item with mouse).

Computer, Libraries and Administrative tools are updated automatically when a file system change occurs and this or parent item was already extracted/shown to the user.

Network and Control panel items aren't refreshed. Restart Power8 when you installed new control panel element or changed network location if needed.

All menu items have a context menu that will allow you to Open item, show it's Properties and so on.

== Computers List ==

When there are more than 10 computers over network available (like if you're in Enterprize-size domain), only 1st ten entries will be shown. All others are accessible via "Computers List" window, that is shown when you click "Show more..." menu item.

This window allows you to quickly search for required computer and open it by double-clicking the entry. Note that when computer is unreachable, "My Documents" window may be opened, or an error message may be shown.

It is planned that there will be a specific configurable context menu with items such as "Start Remote Desktop here" and similar. Fell free to post suggestions for the out-of-box preconfigured items.

== Search ==

http://i36.fastpic.ru/big/2012/0611/10/0676baa21d7d64618a44081ebfa37b10.png

There are 3 ways to search using Power8.

=== Internal search ===
This is the search over everything known to Power8 itself: 
  *  Start menu;
  *  Items displayed in Computer or Documents menu-butons;
  *  Control panel elements;
  *  Network neighborhood.

Minimum search length for this search is 2 characters, so "no" will already bring you Notepad up. Query string is being looked for in elements' path, description or target path if current element is a Link.
This search is immediate. Found elements are grouped according to item under which they were found. Example of the internal search is on screenshot above.

=== Windows Search ===
This search type uses Windows Search engine and can be launched along with internal search. However, to run it, you must have Windows Search enabled on your PC. It is done on W7/W8 by default, but can be switched off. In this case there will be no search results using this search.

Windows Search is used to search system-known FILE elements, with your query as both:
  *  Full-text search (Caption/Header/Title *and* content of documents);
  *  Wildcard search over files' names.
Note that unlike Internal Search, your query is checked with file *names* only while using Windows Search (to make it faster).

Minimum search length of query text is 3 characters, however since it is full-text search, you may prefer using somewhat longer queries for it. Compared with W7 Search window, Power8's queries to WindowsSearch service provide more results than in W7 Start Menu and less results than in Search system window. This search is deferred: when you type a query, it will start only when no key is pressed during 2/3 of second.

By default, Power8 will display only top 50 unique (on the file path level) results of top 100 returned by Windows search. When checking uniqueness, internally returned results are also taken into account.

You can also limit the search results to specific file extension. The format of such query is "extension|query text". When Power8 detects a separator ("|") in a query, only Windows Search occurs, you'll receive no Internal Search results. 

The rule about 3 search text chars is still valid for Limited Windows Search, thus the search won't occur for query "mp3|wh".

=== Internet search ===
This is completely different search type. No results will be produced in P8 window, instead you use it like a shortcut to your favorite search engines. 

The format of query is "key query" (with space inside), where key is 1 character (case sensitive, "a" not equal to "A") from the table below, and query is your search string. At the moment keys are only changeable manually in settings file, in future the settings dialog will be added to set 'em up. By default, the following list is provided:
||b||Bing||
||d||Baidu||
||g||Google.com (https)||
||w||Wikipedia (english)||
||y||Yandex.com||
||в||Wikipedia (русский)||
||г||Google.ru (https)||
||я||Яndex.ru||

This search is not even deferred - it's manual. When you press enter, the default system browser will be launched to show you the results of the search query using the site chosen.
