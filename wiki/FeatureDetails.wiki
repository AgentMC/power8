=Specific features of Power8 described in details=

== Check-for-update ==

This feature checks for new version. When you check the corresponding menu item in context menu of Power8 button, the check begins the same moment.

After that, the check occurs every 12 hours.

Each check downloads 2.26 KB file named "AssemblyInfo.cs" from the project source code and uses it to identify the version.

At the moment, when version is found, only notification is available, later the auto-update will be implemented.

== Alt+Z hotkey ==

Power8 uses Alt+Z hotkey to show Start Window, like Windows itself reacts on "Windows" key. 

The idea originally was to use "Win+Z" hotkey, but starting Windows8, Win+* combinations are prohibited.

When you press Alt+Z, Power8 determines the location of the Mouse cursor and shows the window in the closest desktop corner possible.

Pressing Alt+Z again will close the window.

== Menu buttons ==

All 5 menu buttons have submenus that contain items. 

For Computer and Libraries (Documents on XP) the items are read and expanded only on demand (when you hover the parent menu item with mouse).

Computer, Libraries and Administrative tools are updated automatically when a file system change occurs and this or parent item was already extracted/shown to the user.

Network and Control panel items aren't refreshed. Restart Power8 when you installed new control panel element or changed network location if needed.

All menu items have a context menu that will allow you to Open item, show it's Properties and so on.

== Computers List ==

When there are more than 10 computers over network available (like if you're in Enterprize-size domain), only 1st ten entries will be shown. All others are accessible via "Computers List" window, that is shown when you click "Show more..." menu item.

This window allows you to quickly search for required computer and open it by double-clicking the entry. Note that when computer is unreachable, "My Documents" window may be opened, or an error message may be shown.

It is planned that there will be a specific configurable context menu with items such as "Start Remote Desktop here" and similar. Fell free to post suggestions for the out-of-box preconfigured items.
