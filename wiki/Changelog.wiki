  # `[new]` Serbian, Croatian and Czech localization;
  # `[new]` Hack against doubling icons in Control Panel menu-button under Windows 8.1, see DuplicatedIconsHack for details;
  # `[new]` Key X is now used to expand/collapse current search group;
  # `[new]` Power8 now watches environment variables changes and propagates them to child processes on launch;
  # `[new]` Instead of deprecated Downloads page, Power8 uses Google analytics to track downloads and launches;
  # `[changed]` Most operations are moved to thread pool. This doesn't make them faster but Power8's should impact system load less;
  # `[changed]` Icon extraction is making even less influence on the application performance;
  # `[changed]` Update Notification dialog: progress bar is shown only when download started;
  # `[fixed]` Search returning unexpectedly big amount of results;
  # `[fixed]` Format of logging;

  # `[fixed]` `InvalidOperationException` when the process is launched on Enter key faster than search finishes;
  # `[fixed]` Update Notification dialog was not auto-sizable, and layout of buttons was broken;
  # `[fixed]` Main button's context menu and tooltip layout on Windows7 with Aero disabled (they were partially hidden by toolbar; this doesn't fix that the button itself is hidden by Start button on W7^classic^ by default).

==Version 1.4.4 Beta (v.1.4.4.628): 12.09.2013==

  # `[new]` Arabic localization;

  # `[changed]` Updated translations for all except de, es, fr, zh-TW;
  # `[fixed]` Invalid focus after double Alt+Z;
  # `[fixed]` Display of certain localized CPL items under non-Unicode environment (proper version of `LoadString()` used);
  # `[unconfirmed fix]` Issue19: no feedback from issue reporter, but I hope the bug is fixed now. `NullReferenceException` when Admin Tools folder cannot be inferred from Start Menu;

==Version 1.4.2 Beta (v.1.4.2.599): 01.05.2013==

  # `[new]` Complete key handling for recent list (P to (un-)pin an item, Right / Left arrow opens jump list; Recent list must be focused for these keys to operate). Now really all features of Power8 can be accessed without using of mouse;
  # `[changed]` Enhanced performance of file system event watching (moved FS watching to deferred processing in dedicated thread);
  # `[changed]` Replaced Main button logo again. No re-use of MS logo now;

  # `[fixed]` Exception in `DriveManager` if network share becomes unavailable under certain (domain related) circumstances (reported by Brian Taylor);
  # `[fixed]` Warning sign not disappearing after "Check for updates" was unchecked;
  # `[fixed]` Exclusions list (settings window) might be too high after a lot of items are added to exclusions;
  # `[fixed]` Issue occurring when a link under Start Menu folder is being changed, and an item in Recent list exists that takes the name of a link as Friendly Name to display, AND in case this change might influence the item's representation - this information wasn't stored to the link object, and thus required Power8 to restart to apply required representation changes;

==Version 1.4.1 Beta (v.1.4.1.569): 14.03.2013==

  # `[new]` New settings hack implemented to provide fix to users of Windows7 x86 where some unexpected component exists which prevents Power8 from working in a normal way (see Windows7ExceptionHack);

  # `[new]` "Switch User" command;
  # `[new]` Flexible updater: 
    * no more annoying message boxes on system startup;
    * updater tries to reach server three times with different wait periods until gives up;
    * when updater gives up - it shows warn sign on Power8 button just like for invalid settings, and adds corresponding text to the tooltip;
    * last but not the least: updater switched to the scheduling from timer, so now if you turn on your PC after 12 hours of sleeping, updater will try to check for updates immediately, and not in some hours as before.
  # `[new]` Option to switch between Control panel and "All control panel items" to show when you click "Control panel" button in Power8 window;
