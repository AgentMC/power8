#summary How to translate Power8

= Introduction =

Many people want their favorite software be presented in their language. But independent developers (like we) cannot afford hiring team of professionals each time a new version is released.

Here comes the power of community. If you want Power8 to be run in your mother tongue - no problem, go translate it!

= Details =

What you need is basically just couple of steps:

==1. Get RESX files to translate==
Download these files:
https://power8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Properties/Resources.resx - Main resource file</br>
https://power8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Views/RestartExplorer.resx - Resx for one specific WinForms window shown in quite a special case

==2. Get Tool to translate==
There are many tools to do this. The first simple one I found is [http://sourceforge.net/projects/resx/ Resx Editor]. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/resx/files/latest/download Download] it.

==3. Translate!==
Open the files you got with Resx Editor you got, and translate all the rows you can find in both files.

==4. Join your translation to Power8==
After you translated everything, contact any of the project team members, giving us these files and the Culture you're translating them into. 

That's it! After you give us the files, we'll check them and join to the Power8 source code. They will automatically go to the next version release.

==Side notes==
1) Resx files have comments on some lines - follow them;
2) If you like, after you contributed the translation, we can grant you a Contributor status;
3) Your translation will be automatically shown on the Windows system where current UI language is set to your culture;
4) After your translation is joined the project, we will put your name to main project page, and we can put there some your id/link/etc.
