= Introduction =

In the beginning of 2014 Google deprecated Downloads feature on .Googlecode.com
Senseless, criticized and inefficient, it was their decision, anyway.
This page is how to get *latest* version of Power8.

= Details =

The [https://code.google.com/p/power8/downloads/list Downloads] page won't contain all latest releases now. Last one available there is 1.4.4. Instead, you should use links from within this page, which will always point to latest build, and a previous one.

= Links =

= Older versions =
  * Versions up to 1.4.4 are available under legacy [https://code.google.com/p/power8/downloads/list?can=1 Downloads page];
  * Other versions after 1.4.4 are available in [http://code.google.com/p/power8/source/browse/#svn%2Ffilez this] folder. Current version and previous one will be stored directly in this folder, older releases will be stored in folder Old, and there's also folder for special builds, that you should NOT usually touch.

= Auto-update = 
Auto-update feature should work just like before. From it's point of view nothing changed at all actually.
