== Other known ==
  
===Block===
===High===
  #  7/8: seems sometimes something bad happens in unmanaged code, and heap corruption occurs in CLR. No STR yet, must investigate.
===Medium===
  #  W8RTM: icons for CPL may double (`PostBackgroundDllUnload()` doesn't work as expected... sometimes, cannot reproduce so lowered to Medium for now);
  #  W8RTM: no transparency (should think twice before fixing... window may be not in Windows style after fix);
  #  XP/8?: Menu from menu-button may show in inappropriate position 
===Low===
  #  8/7^Classic^/XP^Classic^: Menu-button's MTLH is repainted improperly on hover 
  #  7/8: Menu item loses selection when context menu is shown
  #  7/8?: Cannot display properties of a Computer object
  #  XP: buttons are 3px lower than menu-buttons
  #  Unneeded right margin in menu items
  #  (?) Some W8 immersive links aren't run properly - have to investigate

== Done => goes to next release ==
  #  7/8: taskbar's panels location is not restored after exit of `Power8` (low because dragging the taskbar fixes the issue)
