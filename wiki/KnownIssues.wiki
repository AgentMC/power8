===Medium===
  #  W8RTM: no transparency (should think twice before fixing... window may be not in Windows style after fix);
  #  No error message may be shown when user has no right to do power action;
  #  XP: Menu from menu-button may show in inappropriate position;
  #  7/8: seems sometimes something bad happens in unmanaged code, and heap corruption occurs in CLR. No STR yet, must investigate. Not reproduced for half a year
===Low===
  #  8/7^Classic^/XP^Classic^: Menu-button's MTLH is repainted improperly on hover 
  #  7/8: Menu item loses selection when context menu is shown
  #  7/8?: Cannot display properties of a Computer object
  #  XP: buttons are 3px lower than menu-buttons
  #  Unneeded right margin in menu items
  #  W8RTM: when changing menu items size only to 12 (W8 feature) the negative icon margin isn't applied proper way;
  #  (?) Some W8 immersive links aren't run properly - have to investigate
